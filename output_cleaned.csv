Rinak S2/S3 into Blue Mage (dies potentially, doesnt matter) > Sharun S3 (kills blue mage, proccs Jenua, he survives 100% with immortality up) > Jenua push in front > Soulburn S1 Jenua into Arunka (this kills if u have >3.500 ATK + 320 CD) > Soulburn S3 Bride Senya. Auto from here, you won.

BEWARE: If Arunka is on PoV, you'll need Jenua on slower build (150 spd) with 4.5k ATK and 350 CD. 

Alternative 1: 
Abyssal Yufine, Lone Wolf Peira, Fallen Cecilia
Assumes Rinak outspeeds:
Rinak S2/S3 into highest Spd unit (usually Peira), Sharun S3. 
If Peira low HP - S3, S1. If Peira dodged all 3 atks and has >50% HP, S1 into Arunka. S3 FCC to transfer debuffs (or in worst case she resisted all) and grant Skill Null. After that pretty much Auto. Slightly prone to Peira dodging.

ALTERNATIVE 2 Strat (untested):
Bride Senya (Bastion of Perlutia), Amiki (150+ ER), Benimaru (15k+ HP)
How does this work?
Rinak S2/S3 into Amiki, does NOT procc. Sharun S3 only proccs Amiki on Cascade, Benimaru survives both at low HP. 
This assumes no counter luck!
Benimaru S3 into Arunka (if Arunka counters, beni will die, run is in danger), if no counter you'll most likely kill something. Bride S3, Amiki S3. Technically you should win this off of all the fix dmg. 

ALTERNATIVE STRAT 2 (turbo unsafe unless you're a spd whale):
Zio at 280+ spd to guarantee Rinak outspeed
Frida or ML Roana
ML Ludwig at 260+ spd full dmg (you will have to SB Zio for this to work)"
Attack,Unit 3,Any Blue Mage,"Main Strat:
Have one Blue Mage (any works) on Book and in Backline, needs enough HP to survive Rinak S2 (just 6* with some whatever gear is good enough)

Lua SB S3; Celine might go 2nd and atk into Lua. You kill her through counters guaranteed. If Luna goes beforehand, you might even keep 1 counter left for Arunka. SB S3 Luna (that's why we have Unseen Observer); S3 Straze to kill Ilynav. Arunka will be low HP, S3 into Lua. she does no dmg because unbuffable. Auto from here.

Krau/FCC ideally on immunity set.

Rinak S2/S3 into Hwa. Peira does something. Belian S3, nobody bats an eye. Krau S3, FCC S3. Focus Belian. Stun Belian with Krau S2. U win at some point. 

ALTERNATIVE COMP 2:
Babe Arunka (Counter/Immuty Set + RP), Ruele, FCC

You focus down Hwa first, then Belian, then Peira. This will take ages unless Babe counters like a goddess."

Ideally all 3 units on immunity

Strat:
We let RNG-sus take the wheel. Most Belian here will be fast on 3f. So expect Amiki, BBK, and Jenua to be low HP. 

Jenua S3 into Hwa. S3 Amiki into either Belian or Hwa (whichever happens to go first between her and Jenua), BBK S3. Auto from there.
