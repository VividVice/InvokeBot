Assumes Rinak outspeeds:
Rinak S2/S3 into highest Spd unit (usually Peira), Sharun S3. 
If Peira low HP - S3, S1. If Peira dodged all 3 atks and has >50% HP, S1 into Arunka. S3 FCC to transfer debuffs (or in worst case she resisted all) and grant Skill Null. After that pretty much Auto. Slightly prone to Peira dodging.

ALTERNATIVE 2 Strat (untested):
Bride Senya (Bastion of Perlutia), Amiki (150+ ER), Benimaru (15k+ HP)
How does this work?
Rinak S2/S3 into Amiki, does NOT procc. Sharun S3 only proccs Amiki on Cascade, Benimaru survives both at low HP. 
This assumes no counter luck!
Benimaru S3 into Arunka (if Arunka counters, beni will die, run is in danger), if no counter you'll most likely kill something. Bride S3, Amiki S3. Technically you should win this off of all the fix dmg. 

ALTERNATIVE STRAT 2 (turbo unsafe unless you're a spd whale):

Frida or ML Roana
ML Ludwig at 260+ spd full dmg (you will have to SB Zio for this to work)"
Attack,Unit 2,Jenua,"Main Strat:
Have one Blue Mage (any works) on Book and in Backline, needs enough HP to survive Rinak S2 (just 6* with some whatever gear is good enough)
Jenua on Wind Rider
DBS - 3F and as much HP as possible, neglect all else. 

Rinak S2/S3 into Blue Mage (dies potentially, doesnt matter) > Sharun S3 (kills blue mage, proccs Jenua, he survives 100% with immortality up) > Jenua push in front > Soulburn S1 Jenua into Arunka (this kills if u have >3.500 ATK + 320 CD) > Soulburn S3 Bride Senya. Auto from here, you won.

Empyrean Ilynav - Rise of a Monarch

Everybody should be at 30k HP and 1700-2000 DEF, some ER on LRK is nice but not needed.

You always Soulburn LRK whenever you can. Keep close watch on Harsetti S3 and plan accordingly. You also use LRK S3 even if you're entirely unbuffable. LRK is who wins you this game as he chips down the enemy team with 3F and stacking S3 dmg.

This comp is esp. strong vs high HP noble oath Arunka"
Defense,Unit 2,Harsetti,"Arby - Alexa's Basket (CD + Torrent set, ideally 5k/350)
Mort - Holy Sac (highest HP >30k)
Senya - Proof of Friendship (ideally some ER)

Prepare for high HP/DEF Babe Arunka on Noble Oath and Immunity set (if counter set bro is dented lol)

Strat: 
Setti S3 > Senya S2 > Senya S3 > Mort S3 > Arunka S3 > Arby most likely dies, cums back > Arby S3 (this should kill either Mort or Setti)

Strat works even if Celine is slower than Spoli but faster than Jenua/Amiki.
